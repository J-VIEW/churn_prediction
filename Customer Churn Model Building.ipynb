So how do you pick a model and a strategy for churn prediction that reflects the realities and nuances of your business? Here's how to approach this process:\n","\n","* **Get to know your business and customers**: Develop a thorough knowledge of your business and customers. What makes your customers stay with the business, and what might drive them away?\n","\n","* **Choose the right data**: Identify the types of data most relevant to your business and customer behavior. This might include transaction history, customer service interactions, or social media activity. Make sure the data is accessible and usable.\n","\n","* **Involve your team**: Solicit input from teams within your organization, such as sales, customer service, and IT. Their insights can help you learn about different aspects of customer interactions and technical feasibility.\n","\n","* **Select an appropriate model**: There's no one-size-fits-all model for churn prediction. Your choice should depend on the nature of your business and the type of data you have. Examine your options closely and determine what might work best for you.\n","\n","* **Prepare and clean your data**: Before you can use your data, it needs to be cleaned and organized.\n","\n","* **Build and test the model**: Once your data is ready, build your predictive model. Test it thoroughly to verify its accuracy and effectiveness.\n","\n","* **Regularly update and refine your model**: Customer behaviors and market conditions change over time. Updating and refining your model regularly is necessary to keep it relevant and effective.\n","\n","* **Turn insights into action**: The final step is to use the insights from your churn prediction model to inform your business strategies. This might involve adjusting your marketing strategy, improving customer service, or making changes to your product.\n","\n","[Learn more about choosing the best prediction model for your business](https://stripe.com/resources/more/churn-prediction-101-how-to-choose-the-best-prediction-model-for-your-business#neural-networks)"],"metadata":{"id":"l8R90jhPvk6q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<center><font size=\"4\">In this notebook, i purpose to build the model using Ensemble method for model building and prediction despite the shortage of enough data<br>\n","Just like all the models the amount of data available and more insights brings the closeness to the why, so that the problem can be solved</font></center>"],"metadata":{"id":"VfXlH8wzv4vE"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gHEaPVqhlBkD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719092792861,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3332,"user":{"displayName":"Pleasant View","userId":"14796331188183011864"}},"outputId":"cc237ecf-6875-43c6-d17a-b6228046d706"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/predict_churn.csv'"],"metadata":{"id":"dAaiwrzxmrEp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719092792861,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":36,"user":{"displayName":"Pleasant View","userId":"14796331188183011864"}}},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","df = pd.read_csv(file_path)"],"metadata":{"id":"KPpIHCZdmvn9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719092792861,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":35,"user":{"displayName":"Pleasant View","userId":"14796331188183011864"}}},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":290},"id":"SbhEBt4ym8eg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719092792862,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":35,"user":{"displayName":"Pleasant View","userId":"14796331188183011864"}},"outputId":"8390e554-1303-4eed-ab73-edf54653a6ac"},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Unnamed: 0  SeniorCitizen  Partner  Dependents  PhoneService  TechSupport  \\\n","0           0              0        1           0             0            0   \n","1           1              0        0           0             1            0   \n","2           2              0        0           0             1            0   \n","3           3              0        0           0             0            1   \n","4           4              0        0           0             1            0   \n","\n","   StreamingTV  StreamingMovies  PaperlessBilling  MonthlyCharges  ...  \\\n","0            0                0                 1           29.85  ...   \n","1            0                0                 0           56.95  ...   \n","2            0                0                 1           53.85  ...   \n","3            0                0                 0           42.30  ...   \n","4            0                0                 1           70.70  ...   \n","\n","   PaymentMethod_Bank transfer (automatic)  \\\n","0                                        0   \n","1                                        0   \n","2                                        0   \n","3                                        1   \n","4                                        0   \n","\n","   PaymentMethod_Credit card (automatic)  PaymentMethod_Electronic check  \\\n","0                                      0                               1   \n","1                                      0                               0   \n","2                                      0                               0   \n","3                                      0                               0   \n","4                                      0                               1   \n","\n","   PaymentMethod_Mailed check  tenure_group_1 -

code without PCA:\n","\n","- The original class distribution is imbalanced, with a significantly higher number of \"No\" churn instances compared to \"Yes\" churn instances.\n","- After applying SMOTEENN, the class distribution becomes more balanced, which helps to improve the performance of the models.\n","- The best performing individual model is \"XGBoost\" with an accuracy of 0.8235.\n","- The combined model, which combines the predictions of all individual models, achieves a slightly higher accuracy of 0.8354.\n","- The classification reports show that the models have good precision and recall scores for both classes, indicating that they can effectively identify both churn and non-churn customers.\n","\n","## Insights from the code with PCA:\n","\n","- After applying PCA, the number of features is reduced while retaining 95% of the variance.\n","- The performance of the models remains relatively consistent after applying PCA, with the best performing individual model still being \"XGBoost\" with an accuracy of 0.8235.\n","- The combined model also achieves a similar accuracy of 0.8354 after applying PCA.\n","- The classification reports show that

insights:\n","\n","- Applying PCA does not significantly impact the performance of the models in this case.\n","- The combined model consistently achieves the highest accuracy, suggesting that ensemble methods can be effective for churn prediction even with imbalanced data and limited features.\n","- Further analysis and tuning of the models may be necessary to improve their performance and
